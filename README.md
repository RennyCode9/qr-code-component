## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

<h2> My Experience </h2>

<p> I was able to master and use Flexbox to design this project as I am not used to using flexbox. I normally use floats. But hopefully I will still improve on my Flexbox skills.

### Useful resources

- [Photopea](https://www.photopea.com/) - This helped me for in picking the background color of the design template I was instructed to replicate. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
